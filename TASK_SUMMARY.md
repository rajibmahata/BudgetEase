  - Collaborator Management (8 tasks)
  - Enhancements (15 tasks)

- **Phase 4: Testing & Quality** (HIGH Priority)
  - Testing (6 tasks)
  - Code Quality (7 tasks)
  - Documentation (6 tasks)

- **Phase 5: Deployment & DevOps**
  - Deployment Preparation (6 tasks)
  - CI/CD (4 tasks)
  - Monitoring (5 tasks)

- **Technical Debt** - Immediate fixes and improvements (15 tasks)
- **Required NuGet Packages** - Complete list with installation commands
- **Progress Tracking** - Visual table showing completion percentages

### 3. Updated README (`README.md`)
Enhanced project README with:

- Current project status and completion percentage
- Links to validation and TODO documents
- Complete features list (implemented vs planned)
- Architecture diagram
- Technology stack table
- Getting started guide
- API endpoints documentation
- Roadmap overview
- Contributing guidelines

### 4. Git Configuration (`.gitignore`)
Standard .NET gitignore file to prevent:
- Build artifacts (bin/, obj/)
- User-specific files
- IDE files
- Database files
- Temporary files

## üìä Key Findings

### What's Working Well
‚úÖ **Solid Backend Foundation**
- Well-designed entity models with proper relationships
- Clean repository pattern implementation
- Complete CRUD operations for all entities
- RESTful API with proper DTOs
- SQLite database with EF Core migrations
- ASP.NET Identity configured

‚úÖ **Good Architecture**
- Clean separation of concerns (Core, Infrastructure, Api, Web)
- Proper dependency injection
- Repository interfaces for testability

### What Needs Work
‚ùå **Authentication** (30% complete)
- No UI pages for login/register
- No API controller for authentication
- No role-based authorization implemented
- Missing password recovery functionality

‚ùå **Frontend** (10% complete)
- Only template pages exist (Counter, Weather)
- No business pages (Dashboard, Events, Expenses, Vendors)
- No authentication state management
- No data binding to API

‚ùå **Integration Features** (0-5% complete)
- No email notifications configured
- No report generation
- No background jobs for reminders
- No dashboard charts

## üìà Impact

This task provides:

1. **Clear Visibility** - Everyone can now see exactly what's done and what's needed
2. **Actionable Plan** - Detailed checklist makes it easy to pick up and continue
3. **Time Estimates** - Realistic 6-9 week timeline for full completion
4. **Prioritization** - Clear HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority levels
5. **Technical Guidance** - Specific libraries and approaches recommended

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **Backend First Approach Works** - The solid backend makes frontend development straightforward
2. **Missing Integration Layer** - The gap between API and UI needs attention
3. **Documentation is Critical** - Without these docs, the project status was unclear
4. **Small Increments** - Breaking into 5 phases makes it less overwhelming

## üöÄ Next Steps Recommendation

**Immediate Priority (Next Sprint):**
1. Implement authentication system
   - Create AuthController with Login/Register/Logout endpoints
   - Add Login.razor and Register.razor pages
   - Configure authentication middleware

2. Build core UI pages
   - Create Dashboard.razor with summary cards
   - Create Events.razor for event list/creation
   - Create Expenses.razor for expense tracking

3. Update navigation
   - Remove template pages
   - Add business navigation links
   - Add authentication status display

**Success Metric:** Users should be able to register, login, and create their first event within 2-3 weeks.
