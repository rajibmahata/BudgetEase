## 3. Database Backup and Restore Validation ✅

### Backup Configuration

**Location:** `appsettings.json`
```json
"DatabaseBackup": {
  "BackupDirectory": "DatabaseBackups",
  "IntervalHours": 24,
  "RetentionDays": 30
}
```

### Backup Service Implementation

#### IDatabaseBackupService Interface ✅
- `CreateBackupAsync()` - Creates timestamped database backup
- `RestoreLatestBackupAsync()` - Restores from most recent backup
- `GetAvailableBackupsAsync()` - Lists all available backups

#### DatabaseBackupService Implementation ✅
**Features:**
- Automatic backup directory creation
- Timestamped backup files (format: `budgetease_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHmmss.db`)
- Connection string parsing to find database location
- Error handling and logging
- Async operations for non-blocking execution

**File Naming Convention:**
- Example: `budgetease_backup_20240115_143022.db`
- Includes date and time for easy identification
- Sorted by creation time (newest first)

#### DatabaseBackupBackgroundService ✅
**Behavior:**
- Runs as a hosted background service
- Executes backup every 24 hours (configurable)
- Starts 30 seconds after application startup
- Continues running until application shutdown
- Logs all operations for monitoring

### Backup Cleanup Implementation

#### BackupCleanupService ✅
**Features:**
- Scans backup directory for files older than retention period
- Default retention: 30 days (configurable)
- Deletes expired backups automatically
- Handles missing directories gracefully
- Detailed logging of cleanup operations

#### BackupCleanupBackgroundService ✅
**Behavior:**
- Runs cleanup every 24 hours (configurable)
- Prevents backup directory from growing indefinitely
- Works in conjunction with backup service
- Independent operation - no dependency on backup service

### Backup Process Flow

#### 1. Application Startup
```
1. Check if database exists
2. If not, attempt restore from latest backup
3. If restored, log success message
4. Run database migrations
5. Seed sample data if needed
```

#### 2. Daily Backup Process
```
1. DatabaseBackupBackgroundService triggers every 24 hours
2. Creates new backup with timestamp
3. Stores in DatabaseBackups/ directory
4. Logs backup creation
5. Continues monitoring for next interval
```

#### 3. Daily Cleanup Process
```
1. BackupCleanupBackgroundService triggers every 24 hours
2. Scans DatabaseBackups/ directory
3. Identifies files older than 30 days
4. Deletes expired backups
5. Logs cleanup summary
```

### Validation Test Results

#### Backup Creation Tests ✅
- ✅ Backup file created with correct naming convention
- ✅ Backup directory auto-created if missing
- ✅ Multiple backups create unique files
- ✅ Graceful handling when database doesn't exist

#### Restore Tests ✅
- ✅ Restores from most recent backup

- ✅ Proper ordering of backup files by date

#### Cleanup Tests ✅
- ✅ Deletes files older than retention period (30 days)
