# Database Backup and Restore Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for the database backup and restore functionality in BudgetEase.

## Quick Test

To quickly verify the backup and restore functionality:

```bash
# 1. Start the API
cd src/BudgetEase.Api
dotnet run

# Wait for the message: "Database Backup Background Service started"
# Wait ~1 minute for first backup
# Look for: "Database backup completed successfully"

# 2. Stop the API (Ctrl+C)

# 3. Verify backup exists
ls -lh DatabaseBackups/
# Should show: budgetease_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.db

# 4. Delete the database
rm budgetease.db budgetease.db-*

# 5. Restart the API
dotnet run

# Look for these messages:
# - "Restoring database from backup"
# - "Database restored successfully"
# - "Database restored from backup successfully"
```

## Detailed Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Verify Automatic Backup Creation

**Objective**: Ensure backups are created automatically on schedule

**Steps**:
1. Start the application
2. Wait for startup logs to complete
3. Wait 1 minute for first backup
4. Check for backup completion log messages
5. Verify backup file exists in `DatabaseBackups/` directory
6. Verify backup file size matches database size

**Expected Results**:
- Log message: "Database Backup Background Service started. Backup interval: 24 hours"
- After 1 minute: "Starting scheduled database backup"
- Log message: "Database backup completed successfully: [path]"
- Backup file exists with correct naming format
- Backup file size > 0 bytes

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f src/BudgetEase.Api/logs/app.log | grep -i backup

# Verify backup file
ls -lh src/BudgetEase.Api/DatabaseBackups/
```

### Test 2: Verify Automatic Restore on Startup

**Objective**: Ensure database is restored from backup when missing

**Steps**:
1. Ensure application is stopped
2. Verify at least one backup exists
3. Delete the main database file
4. Start the application
5. Check for restore log messages
6. Verify database file exists after startup
7. Query database to confirm data was restored

**Expected Results**:
- Log message: "Restoring database from backup: [path]"
- Log message: "Database restored successfully from [path]"
- Log message: "Database restored from backup successfully"
- Database file exists after startup
- Data is intact (can query events, users, etc.)

**Verification**:
```bash
# Start with backup present but no database
rm src/BudgetEase.Api/budgetease.db*
dotnet run --project src/BudgetEase.Api

# After startup, verify database
sqlite3 src/BudgetEase.Api/budgetease.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Events;"
# Should return: 4 (or expected count)
```

### Test 3: Verify Backup Retention/Cleanup

**Objective**: Ensure old backups are automatically deleted

**Steps**:
1. Create multiple backup files with different timestamps
2. Set some files to old creation dates (simulate old backups)
3. Trigger a backup (wait for scheduled backup or restart app)
4. Verify old backups are deleted
5. Verify recent backups remain

**Expected Results**:
- Backups older than retention period are deleted
- Recent backups (within retention period) remain
- Log messages show cleanup operations

**Test Script**:
```bash
cd src/BudgetEase.Api/DatabaseBackups

# Create test backup files with old dates
touch -t 202301010000 budgetease_backup_20230101_000000.db
touch -t 202312010000 budgetease_backup_20231201_000000.db

# Restart app to trigger backup and cleanup
cd ..
dotnet run

# After backup completes, check which files remain
ls -la DatabaseBackups/
# Old files should be gone, recent ones should remain
```

### Test 4: Test Configuration Options

**Objective**: Verify configuration settings work correctly

**Test 4a: Custom Backup Interval**

Update `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "DatabaseBackup": {
    "IntervalHours": 1
  }
}
```

1. Start application
2. Verify log shows: "Backup interval: 1 hours"
3. Wait for first backup (1 minute)
4. Wait for second backup (1 hour + 1 minute)
5. Verify two backups exist

**Test 4b: Custom Backup Directory**

Update `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "DatabaseBackup": {
    "BackupDirectory": "/tmp/custom-backups"
  }
}
```

1. Start application
2. Verify backups go to `/tmp/custom-backups/`

**Test 4c: Custom Retention Period**

Update `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "DatabaseBackup": {
    "RetentionDays": 7
  }
}
```

1. Create backups with dates 8+ days old
2. Trigger backup
3. Verify only backups within 7 days remain

### Test 5: Error Handling

**Test 5a: No Permission to Write Backups**

1. Create backup directory with read-only permissions
2. Start application
3. Verify error is logged
4. Verify application continues to run

**Test 5b: No Backup Files for Restore**

1. Delete all backup files
2. Delete database file
3. Start application
4. Verify log shows: "No backup files found"
5. Verify new database is created from migrations
6. Verify seeding occurs

**Test 5c: Corrupted Backup File**

1. Create a corrupted backup file (empty or invalid SQLite)
2. Delete database
3. Start application
4. Verify error handling and logging

### Test 6: Concurrent Operations

**Objective**: Ensure backup works correctly during database operations

**Steps**:
1. Start application
2. Begin making API calls (create events, expenses, etc.)
3. Wait for scheduled backup to run
4. Verify backup completes successfully
5. Verify API operations continue normally
6. Verify backup contains recent changes

### Test 7: Large Database Backup

**Objective**: Ensure backup works with larger databases

**Steps**:
1. Populate database with large amount of data (1000+ records)
2. Trigger backup
3. Measure backup time
4. Verify backup file size
5. Test restore with large backup

**Expected Results**:
- Backup completes successfully
- Backup time is reasonable
- Restore works correctly
- All data is preserved

## Unit Tests

Run the unit tests for backup functionality:

```bash
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~DatabaseBackupServiceTests"
```

**Expected Test Results**:
- ✅ BackupDatabaseAsync_CreatesBackupFile_WhenDatabaseExists
- ✅ BackupDatabaseAsync_ReturnsEmpty_WhenDatabaseDoesNotExist
- ✅ RestoreLatestBackupAsync_RestoresDatabase_WhenBackupExists
- ✅ RestoreLatestBackupAsync_ReturnsFalse_WhenDatabaseAlreadyExists
- ✅ RestoreLatestBackupAsync_ReturnsFalse_WhenNoBackupsExist
- ✅ GetAvailableBackupsAsync_ReturnsBackupsInDescendingOrder
- ✅ CleanupOldBackupsAsync_DeletesOldBackups

All 7 tests should pass.

## Integration Testing

### Test End-to-End Workflow

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Complete integration test script

echo "Starting integration test..."

cd src/BudgetEase.Api

# Clean start
echo "Cleaning up existing files..."
rm -rf budgetease.db* DatabaseBackups/

# Start application
echo "Starting application..."
dotnet run &
APP_PID=$!

# Wait for startup
sleep 10

# Wait for first backup (1 minute delay + processing)
echo "Waiting for first backup..."
sleep 70

# Check backup exists
if [ -f DatabaseBackups/budgetease_backup_*.db ]; then
    echo "✅ Backup created successfully"
else
    echo "❌ Backup creation failed"
    kill $APP_PID
    exit 1
fi

# Stop application
echo "Stopping application..."
kill $APP_PID
sleep 2

# Delete database
echo "Deleting database..."
rm budgetease.db*

# Restart application
echo "Restarting application to test restore..."
dotnet run &
APP_PID=$!

# Wait for restore
sleep 10

# Verify database exists
if [ -f budgetease.db ]; then
    echo "✅ Database restored successfully"
else
    echo "❌ Database restore failed"
    kill $APP_PID
    exit 1
fi

# Verify data
EVENT_COUNT=$(sqlite3 budgetease.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Events;")
if [ "$EVENT_COUNT" -gt "0" ]; then
    echo "✅ Data restored successfully ($EVENT_COUNT events)"
else
    echo "❌ Data restore failed"
    kill $APP_PID
    exit 1
fi

# Clean up
echo "Cleaning up..."
kill $APP_PID

echo "✅ All integration tests passed!"
```

## Performance Testing

### Backup Performance Test

```bash
# Test backup time with various database sizes

# Small database (~1MB)
time dotnet test --filter "BackupDatabaseAsync_CreatesBackupFile_WhenDatabaseExists"

# Measure production backup time
tail -f logs/app.log | grep "backup completed"
# Should complete in < 1 second for typical database sizes
```

### Restore Performance Test

```bash
# Test restore time
time dotnet test --filter "RestoreLatestBackupAsync_RestoresDatabase_WhenBackupExists"

# Measure production restore time
tail -f logs/app.log | grep "restored successfully"
# Should complete in < 2 seconds for typical database sizes
```

## Monitoring in Production

### Log Monitoring

Monitor these log patterns:

```bash
# Successful backup
grep "Database backup completed successfully" logs/*.log

# Failed backup
grep -i "error.*backup" logs/*.log

# Successful restore
grep "Database restored successfully" logs/*.log

# Background service status
grep "Database Backup Background Service" logs/*.log
```

### Health Checks

Create a health check endpoint to verify backup status:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/health/backup", async (IDatabaseBackupService backupService) =>
{
    var backups = await backupService.GetAvailableBackupsAsync();
    var backupCount = backups.Count();
    var latestBackup = backups.FirstOrDefault();
    
    return new
    {
        status = backupCount > 0 ? "healthy" : "warning",
        backupCount,
        latestBackup,
        latestBackupAge = latestBackup != null 
            ? DateTime.UtcNow - File.GetCreationTimeUtc(latestBackup)
            : null
    };
});
```

## Troubleshooting Test Failures

### Backup Not Created

1. Check application logs for errors
2. Verify file permissions on backup directory
3. Verify disk space availability
4. Check configuration in appsettings.json
5. Verify database file exists and is accessible

### Restore Failed

1. Verify backup files exist
2. Check backup file is valid SQLite database
3. Verify file permissions
4. Check logs for specific error messages
5. Ensure database directory is writable

### Tests Timing Out

1. Increase delay times in tests
2. Check system performance
3. Verify no other processes blocking files
4. Check disk I/O performance
